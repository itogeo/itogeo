        <h2>About Ito Geospatial</h2>
        <p>
          Ito Geospatial supports agencies and community groups that need geospatial horsepower without a full internal department.
          We focus on remote sensing, elevation model cleanup, and pragmatic automation that keeps local data accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every engagement is hands-on. We scale a core team of full-time staff with rotating specialists, verify every input,
          and leave behind tools and training that stand up to public review.
