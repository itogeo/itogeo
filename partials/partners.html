    <h2>MSU’s Geospatial Core Facility Stays Embedded on Every Mapping Push</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Our long-term collaboration with the Montana State University Geospatial Core Facility keeps every workflow grounded in peer-reviewed rigor.
      Their lidar lab reviews our pipelines, validates new cartography techniques, and co-builds demos before they reach client stakeholders.

      <h3>MSU Geospatial Core Facility</h3>
      <p>
        The MSU GCF team pressure-tests our remote sensing, cartography, and Mapbox delivery pipelines. They stress the data,
        document validation steps, and keep our terrain updates peer-review ready before we share them with counties or
        corporate innovation teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together we co-author data stories, stand up compute in their lab when projects need extra horsepower, and bring student
        researchers into production builds so every map feels contemporary and defensible.
