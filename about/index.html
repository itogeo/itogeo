        <h1>Practical Geospatial Support for Local Projects</h1>
        <p>
          Ito Geospatial is a services studio that makes modern spatial data and tools usable for any team&mdash;from long-term government programs to focused community initiatives.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <div class="bio-grid">
        <div>
          <p>
            Ito Geospatial is headquartered in Bozeman, Montana, and we exist to make modern spatial analysis approachable. Our core team handles the heavy lifting—remote sensing, elevation cleanup, automation—then hands back deliverables and tools that smaller staffs can steward on their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it is a multi-year government program or a focused improvement for a local group, we scale the right mix of staff and rotating specialists to match the need. Every engagement centers on adoption—shared workflows, clear story maps, and quick training so people are confident using the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The playbook stays the same: gather the best inputs, document every assumption, and deliver pipelines that withstand turnover. Clients own the results, and we stay available when fresh data or new questions come up.
