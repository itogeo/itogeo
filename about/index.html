        <h1>Geospatial Tools That Work for Everyone</h1>
        <p>
          We're a team of engineers, scientists, and cartographers who believe the best mapping tools are the ones
          your whole team can use—not just the GIS specialist.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <div class="bio-grid">
        <div>
          <p>
            Based in Bozeman, Montana, we started Ito Geospatial because we kept seeing the same problem:
            small governments and organizations needed professional mapping capabilities, but couldn't afford
            a dedicated GIS department—or got handed tools so complex that only one person knew how to use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We build differently. Every workflow is designed to be run by your existing staff. Every map is
            documented so your board members understand where the data comes from. Every tool is tested by
            people who aren't GIS experts, because that's who'll be using it day-to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result? Agencies that can answer their own questions. Utilities that can update their own
            asset maps. Watershed councils that can show stakeholders exactly what changed and why.
            We hand over the keys—and stay on call when you need us.

        <div>
          <h3>Clarity First</h3>
          <p>Plain-language findings with enough documentation that councils, boards, and field crews trust the output.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Rigorous & Repeatable</h3>
          <p>Workflows are versioned, logged, and packaged so internal staff can rerun updates without guesswork—even years later.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Side-by-Side Delivery</h3>
          <p>We stay embedded until every stakeholder is comfortable using the data, whether that's a quick screen share or a field day.</p>
