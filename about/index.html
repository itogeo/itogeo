        <h1>Mapping Systems for Governments and the Private Sector</h1>
        <p>
          Ito Geospatial is a modern mapping studio inspired by the creative rigor of teams like Stamen. We translate geospatial science into accessible applications, story-driven cartography, and field-ready workflows for agencies, utilities, and private firms.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <div class="bio-grid">
        <div>
          <p>
            Based in Bozeman, Montana, we help people see their projects through maps first. We pair remote sensing, elevation refinement, and spatial data science with editorial cartography so complex ideas land with boards, tribal governments, investors, and field crews.
          </p>
          <p>
            Private firms lean on us to stand up geospatial data applications, while city, state, and federal partners count on us to rebuild workflows that their staff can actually run. We obsess over clarity: every deck, dashboard, and notebook is designed so a new hire can pick it up months later.
          </p>
          <p>
            The approach is simple—work closely with lab partners, document every transformation, and hand back durable mapping systems powered by the same Mapbox, Esri, and open-source stacks we use in production. Clients own the results, and we stay on call when new datasets or policy questions surface.

          <h3>Clarity First</h3>
          <p>Plain-language findings with enough documentation that councils, boards, and field crews trust the output.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Rigorous & Repeatable</h3>
          <p>Workflows are versioned, logged, and packaged so internal staff can rerun updates without guesswork—even years later.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Side-by-Side Delivery</h3>
          <p>We stay embedded until every stakeholder is comfortable using the data, whether that's a quick screen share or a field day.</p>
